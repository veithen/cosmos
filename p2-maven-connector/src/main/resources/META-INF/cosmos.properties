# Don't let P2 use mirrors. There are two reasons for this:
# 1) Mirrors may occasionally be unreachable. Using them would make the build less stable and predictable.
# 2) P2 may use a mirror that uses a different protocol, typically FTP instead of HTTP. This is
#    a problem when building from behind a proxy: since Maven repositories almost exclusively use
#    HTTP, users generally don't have a correct FTP proxy configuration in settings.xml. Allowing P2
#    to switch to FTP would then cause occasional failures.
